# TagsCount
Tags count for flow data
please download the solution.py and tags_count and flow_Data files on to the same directory and just run the test.py file.
Once the file runs, it generates output.txt file in the same directory
Assumptions made-
1) flow_data would be of the format given in the flow_data.txt which was taken from an example in the link shared, also space seperated
2) lookup data assumption data in the tags_data.txt(csv hence comman seperated)
